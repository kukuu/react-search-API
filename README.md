## REACT SEARCH API

Building great search requires two sophisticated parts: 

1. the search engine, which provides APIs to power search and 

2. the search library, which paints the search experience.

The search API allows a user to query for results from a selection of data. In REACT we filter after ComponentWillMount/

REACT then decides  whether or not the component can be mounted. Then it will call SORT and then FILTER on the data. The filter method iterates over the array and applies a returned expression to every element of the array.


## Types of SEARCH

1. Autocomplete:

Also known as autosuggest or search suggest, is a feature that provides predictions as you type in a text box. It is commonly associated with search engines, though it may be used for other purposes as well. 

2. Autofill:

With autofill, you can select a field in the form, choose what you autofill data you want to enter, and all fields will be filled out automatically. 

3. Synonym SEARCHES

4. CURATIONS (Restricting Synonyms)

5. RELEVANCE tuning (faking most relevant by transferring in descriptions context data across)
